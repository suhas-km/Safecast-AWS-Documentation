## Introduction

The Safecast project utilizes various AWS services to collect, store, and analyze radiation data worldwide. This documentation provides an overview of the AWS infrastructure used in the project and serves as a guide for developers and administrators.

## Services and Products
This is the list of Safecast Services primarily running on the AWS Cloud.
1) The Safecast API
2) Grafana/Kibana Dashboards
3) 

## Architecture Overview

The architecture of the Safecast AWS infrastructure is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and highly available. It consists of multiple components, including:

- Data collection and ingestion
- Data storage and processing
- Data analysis and visualization
- Monitoring and alerting
- Security and access control

## AWS Services

The Safecast AWS infrastructure leverages several AWS services, including but not limited to:

- Amazon S3 for data storage
- Amazon EC2 for virtual server instances
- Amazon RDS for managed databases
- Amazon Lambda for serverless computing
- Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and logging
- Amazon VPC for network isolation
- Amazon IAM for access control

For a complete list of AWS services used in the Safecast project, refer to the project's documentation.

## Deployment Process

The deployment process for the Safecast AWS infrastructure follows a CI/CD approach. Changes to the infrastructure are managed through version control and automated deployment pipelines. The process includes steps such as:

1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) provisioning
2. Configuration management
3. Testing and validation
4. Deployment to production environment

## Monitoring and Alerting

To ensure the health and performance of the Safecast AWS infrastructure, various monitoring and alerting mechanisms are in place. These include:

- CloudWatch metrics and alarms
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Application performance monitoring (APM) tools
- Incident response and escalation procedures

## Cost Optimization

Cost optimization is an important aspect of managing the Safecast AWS infrastructure. To minimize costs, strategies such as:

- Right-sizing of resources
- Reserved instances and savings plans
- Spot instances for non-critical workloads
- Lifecycle management of data and resources

are implemented.

## Security

Security is a top priority for the Safecast AWS infrastructure. Measures such as:

- Network isolation using VPCs and security groups
- Encryption of data at rest and in transit
- Identity and access management using IAM
- Regular security assessments and audits

are implemented to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the infrastructure.

## Troubleshooting

In case of issues or incidents, a troubleshooting guide is available to assist in identifying and resolving problems in the Safecast AWS infrastructure. The guide includes steps for:

- Log analysis and debugging
- Performance optimization
- Incident response and recovery
